# Implementation
Game developed using Pygame along with NEAT library for incorporating AI.

## Added AI
Automated the game using NEAT algorithm to naturally select the best neural networks over a number of generations, eventually leading to crossing the 100 score mark.

## How to run game
Clone the repository and then simply run the main-game.py file in the game subfolder. Though you'd need to have Pygame and other depencies installed.

## Future Scope
Working on converting the python code into web assembly and hosting it online.
