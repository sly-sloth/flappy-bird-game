# Implementation
Done using Python OOP along with Pygame library for the UI.

## How to run game
Clone the repository and then simply run the main-game.py file in the game subfolder. Though you'd need to have Pygame and other depencies installed.

## Future Scope
Working on converting the python code into web assembly and hosting it online.
